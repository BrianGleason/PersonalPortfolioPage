        Reduced cost and increased efficiency of data collection from AWS by eliminating unnecessary calls based on customer usage, \
        shortening job runtimes by preventing overseas queries, and decreasing AWS throttling by minimizing calls to smaller regions. \
        Saved over 950 million API calls per day, a 23% decrease in system-wide API calls, generated a 35-45% decrease in job runtimes for \
        impacted services, and reduced throttling from AWS \
        Wrote project design document, added JIRA tickets for the project, and made essential design decisions.",
